### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Whats on your mind? An Exploratory Analysis of Philosophical Texts
+ This project is conducted by Marvin Limpijankit

+ Project summary: [a short summary] This analysis involves the "Philosophy Dataset" that contains a compilation of sentences written by famous philosophers in their texts. This analysis seeks to understand if there are any patterns or commanlities among philosophers, their ideas, and also if these ideas/opinions have changed over time. Do certain philosophers think more similarly to others? Will the sentiments of philosophers in their text fall into groups based on schools of thought? What topics are they mostly concerned with and how have their attitudes towards these topics changed over time?
