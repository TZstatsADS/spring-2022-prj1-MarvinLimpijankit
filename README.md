### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Whats on your mind? An Exploratory Analysis of Philosophical Texts
+ This project is conducted by Marvin Limpijankit

+ Project summary: [a short summary] This analysis involves the "Philosophy Dataset" that contains a compilation of sentences written by famous philosophers in their texts. This analysis seeks to understand if there are any patterns or commanlities among philosophers, their ideas, and also if these ideas/opinions have changed over time. Do certain philosophers think more similarly to others? Will the sentiments of philosophers in their text fall into groups based on schools of thought? What topics are they mostly concerned with and how have their attitudes towards these topics changed over time?

Note: the project uses the philosophy dataset csv file which is not included in 'data' due to space restrictions. Also, certain output files have been omitted since they were also too large to be stored. Therefore I did most of the time-costly analysis tasks on those datasets and exported them into smaller files to be included in 'output'. Some of the commented out code does this, helping generate the data (but the code is commented out since I have already done these steps). I was also not able to hide code cells and import functions from other files so the analysis is a bit lengthy (could not figure it out in time despite searching multiple times). Enjoy!
